# Concept-Driven Continual Learning

This is the official implemenation of our [TMLR 2024 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HSW49uvCNW): "Concept-Driven Continual Learning". 

* In this work, we propose to bring interpretability into continual learning process to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems.
* We proposed two novel methods **Interpretability-Guided Continual Learning (IG-CL)** and **Intrinsically-Interpretable Neural Network (IN2)** that can systematically manage human-understandable concepts within DNNs.
* Our proposed approaches provide unprecedented transparency and control over the continual learning process, marking a promising new direction in designing continual learning algorithms.

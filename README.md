# Concept-Driven Continual Learning

This is the official implemenation of our TMLR paper: [Concept-Driven Continual Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HSW49uvCNW). 


In this work, we propose to bring interpretability into continual learning. Our proposed methods **Interpretability-Guided Continual Learning (IG-CL)** and **Intrinsically-Interpretable Neural Network (IN2)** can systematically manage human-understandable concepts within DNNs, providing unprecedented transparency and control over the continual learning process. This marks a promising new direction to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problems in continual learning.
